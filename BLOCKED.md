Questions only the owner can answer. The name, hosting and Loco questions were answered on
2026-09-24 (below). What is still with the owner: the publish (M13, on hold), posting the
announcement (M26), and turning on GitHub Pages and pushing once the snapshot exists.

## Name, license and repository (M13, box 1), answered

Answered 2026-09-24: **license is MIT**. `license = "MIT"` is set in both manifests, and
`LICENSE` sits at the root with `luis-serrano-l` (the git user name) as the copyright holder.
Edit that line if you want your full name there.

Answered 2026-09-24: the name was `axum-nojs`. **Renamed 2026-09-25 to `loco-ui`**: "nojs"
promised no JavaScript while an optional script ships. The crates are `loco-ui`,
`loco-ui-caps`, `loco-ui-macros` and `loco-ui-test` (not published); classes, tokens, cookies,
attributes and routes use the `lui-` prefix (`.lui-dialog`, `--lui-accent`, `lui-ui`,
`data-lui`, `/lui/enhance.js`), and the macro is `lui!`. `loco-ui` was free on crates.io on
2026-09-25. Yours: rename the GitHub repository to `loco-ui` (GitHub redirects the old URL)
before the next push, since the manifests and README already point there.

Answered 2026-09-24: **the repository is https://github.com/luis-serrano-l/loco-ui**
(public), set as `repository` in both manifests.

## The publish itself (M13, box 4), on hold

On hold at the owner's request (2026-09-24). The rename is done and `repository` is set; publish only on the owner's yes. Never run on your behalf. M25 puts it after M26, whose naming box (below) may still change the crate names.

## Rename to `nojs-ui`? (M26, box 1), answered

Answered 2026-09-24: keep `axum-nojs`. Reversed 2026-09-25: renamed to `loco-ui` (above).

## Launch: host the demo, post the announcement (M26, last box), partly answered

Hosting answered 2026-09-24: **a static snapshot on GitHub Pages.** Pages serves only static
files, so the snapshot shows every page as it renders, and `<dialog>`, `popover`, `<details>`
and tooltips still work. Forms, cookies and paging need the server, and a banner on every page
says so. The export (`scripts/snapshot.sh`) and the workflow (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`) are done.
Yours: Settings → Pages → Source "GitHub Actions", then push `main`; the site lands at
https://luis-serrano-l.github.io/loco-ui/ (put that link in `docs/launch-post.md`).

Posting stays with you and waits for the publish: the draft is `docs/launch-post.md`, and the
suggested order is crate first, then r/rust and This Week in Rust, with the Pages link filled in.

Done locally: the crates.io keywords are `no-js`, `maud`, `ssr`, `components` and `axum`.
`progressive-enhancement` is longer than crates.io's 20-character limit, so the phrase is in
the description instead.

## Make Loco the primary target? (M27, box 1), answered

Answered 2026-09-24: **yes, as a `loco` feature on `loco-ui`**, not a separate crate. The rest
of M27 is unblocked. The Loco API names in ROADMAP M27 are from memory and get checked against
loco-rs's source before anything is built on them.

## Reply to Blitz issue #923

Posted on 2026-09-23 after the owner's approval:
https://github.com/DioxusLabs/blitz/issues/923#issuecomment-5800768284

## Copy-paste mode: what does a vendored file keep? (M29, "Copy-paste mode" box), open

`cargo lui add <component>` would copy a component's file into the app (shadcn and templUI
do this). loco-ui components read the request through `Ui` (caps, theme, state, language)
and build on the primitives (`Button`, `Input`, `Icon`, the i18n table, `enhance::swap_id`),
so a copied file cannot stand alone. Options:

1. **Keep `use loco_ui::…`** (suggested): the vendored file imports `Ui`, the primitives and
   the i18n table from the crate, and only the component's own markup, CSS and `PROPS` are
   the app's to edit. Small, stays in step with fixes to the primitives; the app still
   depends on `loco-ui`.
2. **Copy everything it touches**: the file plus `Ui`, the primitives and their CSS, renamed
   into the app. Fully owned, but hundreds of lines per component and no upstream fixes.
3. **Do not build it**: the blocks and the "write your own" page (M24) already show how to
   make a component in the app; the spec JSON is the registry for tools.

Suggested answer: 1, with the command writing `src/components/<name>.rs` and registering its
CSS through `Page::css`. Nothing is built until you choose.

## Ask Loco to link loco-ui (M29, last box), open

An outward action, and it waits for the publish (M13/M29): a crate that is only a git
dependency is a hard thing to link to. Suggested, once `loco-ui` is on crates.io: a post in
Loco's GitHub Discussions ("Show and tell"), not an issue, along these lines:

> loco-ui: server-rendered scaffolds for Loco 1.x. `cargo lui install` adds an initializer
> and scaffold templates, so `cargo loco generate scaffold` writes HTML controllers and Maud
> views (Post/Redirect/Get, validation that re-renders, paging from `PagerMeta`), and
> `cargo lui auth` writes sign-in, sign-up, reset and magic-link pages. Every page works with
> JavaScript off (tested in CI with a script-less renderer); an optional 11 KB script updates
> pages in place. Example app: examples/loco-app. Would a link from the generators docs,
> next to the note on the removed `--html` scaffolds, be welcome?

Yours: whether, when and where to post it.

## File the M30 Blitz gaps upstream (M30, last box), open

M30 recorded Blitz 0.3.0-beta.2 gaps in FINDINGS.md ("M30 · The Linear / Magic UI look").
Two already link issues (#196 for `:modal`/`:popover-open`, #863 for transitions); these have
no upstream issue, and filing one is an outward action:

1. `@starting-style` is parsed but never applied: Stylo resolves starting styles only in its
   Gecko build (`maybe_resolve_starting_style` is `cfg(feature = "gecko")`).
2. `@property` is unsupported: a registered property's `initial-value` is ignored and
   `@keyframes` cannot animate it.
3. `@supports (animation-timeline: view())` is true, but no scroll timeline runs.
4. `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` never matches.
5. `get_client_bounding_rect` ignores `translate` and `scale`.
6. A `z-index: -1` `::after` inside an `isolation: isolate` element with a sized
   `radial-gradient` is not painted (the card `.glow()`); the cause is not isolated yet.

Suggested: one issue per item on github.com/DioxusLabs/blitz, each with a minimal HTML file
(items 1–4 can share one "motion features" issue if the maintainers prefer), then replace
"(no upstream issue yet; the owner files it)" in FINDINGS.md with the links. Nothing else in
the library waits on it: every effect has its at-rest fallback proved in Blitz today.

## One snippet style: `/wizard` and `/palette` (M34, "One snippet style" box), open

`/counter` now shows `lui!` (its rules are three constants the post handler shares). The
wizard and the palette cannot follow without a choice: their handlers call methods on the
builder after building it (`wizard.at(step)`, `.is_last(..)`, `.link(..)`; `palette.exact()`),
and `lui!` only returns `Markup`. The options:

1. **A builder mode in `lui!`** (suggested): for example `lui!(build: Wizard("signup",
   "/wizard") { step "Account" (..); .. })`, expanding to the same chain but returning the
   builder instead of wrapping it in `html!`. The component functions keep one definition,
   the snippets read like every other page, and the macro's `component()` already produces
   that expression, so it is small. It is new macro syntax, which is why it is yours.
2. Show `lui!` on the page and keep a second builder chain for the handler, from shared data.
   No macro change, but each page defines its steps or links twice.
3. Keep the chain on these two pages, and let the snippet test allow it.

The demo test that stops snippets drifting back waits on this answer.
